        <p>As a freshman, I was set on pursuing a major and career in aerospace engineering, however I was still interested in artificial intelligence, even before the release of ChatGPT. Especially as a car enthusiast, I was really excited about AI‚Äôs applications to autonomous vehicles as well as other things in industry such as robotics and image/text generation.<br><br> After the release of GPT 3.5, my interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning spiked again, and I decided at the very last minute to pursue a major in computer science instead of aerospace engineering. <br><br>Since then, for the past two years, I‚Äôve been dedicating my free time into expanding my skills and knowledge in the area and building projects utilizing it.<br><br> My technical skills have mostly come from self-learning through YouTube and other online materials, which I‚Äôve linked below. I participated in an Aggies Invent event focused on AI, where I worked with a team to develop a deep fake detection chrome extension. This landed my team and I a first place win as well as a cash prize of $5000. This event not only greatly expanded my technical knowledge, but also my network and communication skills. I‚Äôve also worked on other AI projects in events like TAMUhack and on my own. <br><br>The knowledge and passion I have for the field allowed me to work at two AI related internships over the past summer where I worked with generative AI. At my first internship, I developed a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) application that allowed users to input their resume and be asked both technical and non-technical interview questions based on their skills. At my second internship, I developed a natural language to SQL conversion agent, that allowed non-technical users to generate data queries. These have built me into the engineer that I am today, and I‚Äôm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to develop my skill set and build new applications.
